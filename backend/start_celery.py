Celery Worker Startup Script for Vehicle Parking App - DISABLED

This script is disabled since we've switched to MongoDB and removed Redis/Celery dependencies.
Background jobs now run synchronously within the main application.

Original purpose:
- Start Celery worker to process background jobs
- Required Redis as message broker
- Provided async job processing

Current status: DISABLED - Jobs run synchronously
